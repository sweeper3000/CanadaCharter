<p>CanadaCharter is an Android app that displays the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in an offline form.</p>

<p>I made this when I noticed that there are many apps of the United States Bill of Rights, and even one of the Phillipine Constitution, but nothing for Canada.</p>

<p><strong>The app is currently under active development</strong></p>

<p>See the app <a href="https://github.com/sweeper3000/CanadaCharter">here</a>. Most work is currently being done under <code class="highlighter-rouge">sweeper3000/main-activity-layout</code> before I merge it into master.</p>
