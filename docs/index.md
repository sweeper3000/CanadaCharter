CanadaCharter is an Android app that displays the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in an offline form.

I made this when I noticed that there are many apps of the United States Bill of Rights, and even one of the Phillipine Constitution, but nothing for Canada.

**The app is currently under active development**

See the app [here](https://github.com/sweeper3000/CanadaCharter). Most work is currently being done under `sweeper3000/main-activity-layout` before I merge it into master.
