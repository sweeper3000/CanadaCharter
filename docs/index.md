CanadaCharter is an Android app that displays the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in an offline form.

I made this when I noticed that there are many apps of the United States Bill of Rights, and even one of the Phillipine Constitution, but nothing for Canada.

See the app [here](https://github.com/sweeper3000/CanadaCharter).
